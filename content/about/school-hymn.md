In all the years, you have existed,\
Your love for wisdom, has never failed,\
And we're all here, to sing you praises,\
For teaching us, only the best.

Beloved school, our Alma Mater,\
Oh for your love,\
What tongue can tell!\
For through your guidance,\
We proudly stand,\
As beautiful flowers in your hands.

#### Chorus
Oh, Mystical Rose School of Caloocan,\
We hail you, praise you\
Our joy and crown!\
The things you taught shall always be in our hearts,\
To light our ways and the paths we trod.

#### Bridge
With your glorious banner waving high,\
The emblem of our highest pride,\
We promise you our love and loyalty,\
For giving us life's victory.

#### Chorus
Oh, Mystical Rose School of Caloocan,\
We hail you, praise you\
Our joy and crown!\
The things you taught shall always be in our hearts,\
To light our ways and the paths we trod.
