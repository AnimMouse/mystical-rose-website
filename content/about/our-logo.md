The School Logo carries four symbols: The Torch, the Book, the Dove and the Laurel Leaves.

The Torch represents the source of the light that leads every Rosean in achieving his/her goals.

The Book signifies the wisdom, knowledge and dedication that the administrators, faculty and staff impart to every Rosean

The Dove between the Torch and Laurel leaves signifies the peaceful and harmonious relationship that exists among the administrators, teachers and students inside and outside and other sectors of the community.

The Laurel Leaves represent the achievements that every Rosean has reaped and will continuously earn in the years to come.
