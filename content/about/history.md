The Mystical Rose School of Caloocan, Inc. began as preschool in 1993. Founded by the couple Dr. Rolando Molato-Gregore and Dr. Marcelina Loqueño-Gregore, both Doctor of Philosophy in Developmental Education.

The humble beginning of MRSCI is a long time dream of the couple put into reality. It started with two classrooms, at #15 Ilang-ilang St. Almar Subd., Camarin, Caloocan City, Dr. Marcelina Gregore was a preschool teacher before she got married to Dr. Rolando Gregore. Teacher Marcie as fondly called by her pupils, is really passionate to teach and is well-loved by the children, that she was the first teacher of the first batch of preschool students, 14 Kinder and 12 Prep.

The next school year, the population tripled. The school had to hire teacher to handle classes which Teacher Marcie could not attend to.

Three years after, year 1997, positive feedbacks flooded the school and so elementary level was offered then. Additional classrooms were built through the financial support of Dr. Rolando M. Gregore who was a Seaman Radio Officer in the overseas assignment. Now he is a PRC License Holder as Officer of the Navigations Watch with a rank of Second/Third Officer. The first school principal was the late Ma’am Elma E. Castro. The parents of the first batch of graduating grade six students requested the administrators to offer the First Year and Second Year High School, and so it happened year 2000. One of the pioneer high school teachers is Miss Maricel C. Zenarosa, now Mrs. Maricel Zenarosa-Roque, the school Senior Vice-Principal.
