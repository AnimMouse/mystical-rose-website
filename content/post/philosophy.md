Pilosopo of the School:

Every student is different in the color of his personality, it is manifested in his own individuality. Because he is unique and vastly different from others he has his own way of development. Using the premise, the school aims to continuously nurture his development through the provision of enriching learning activities inside and outside the classroom, meaningful educational materials/facilities that suit his needs, and employment of well-trained teachers. The school believes that students are like flowers that bloom at different times but through constant care and nourishment they can bloom to the fullest.
