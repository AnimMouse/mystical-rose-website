The media influences so many peopleâ€™s behavior nowadays. Information can be spread after a few clicks of a button, whether it is true, false, speculation or gossip. The media can manipulate, influence, persuade and pressure society, along with even controlling the world at times in both positive and negative ways; mentally, physically, and emotionally.\
In its 3rd year, Rosean Student Film Festival will showcase our Grade 12 students' creativity in storytelling on how media affect social change and how media can be a platform for change.\
Who will become this year's winner of the Best Film and Gawad Rosean Award?\
Watch out for our 26 short film entries full trailer this April 12, 2021, at 3:00 pm via Facebook Livestream together with your Rosean Tambalan DJs.
