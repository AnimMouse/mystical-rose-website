## ADVISORY

We would like to inform you that there will be no Synchronous classes for all grade levels and subjects starting tomorrow, September 25, until Wednesday, September 30, 2020.

This is in line with the network advisories released by several Internet Service Providers regarding their maintenance activities which may cause degraded internet connectivity.

Kindly take this time to assist your child in completing his/her unfinished modules in their LMS and to prepare for the upcoming Mastery Test / Preliminary Examinations on October 1 to 2, 2020.

Please be guided accordingly.
