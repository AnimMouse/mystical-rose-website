Dear Rosean Parents and Students,

We would like to inform you that as instructed recently by DepEd - Division of Caloocan, there will be no face to face distribution of cards while the city is still in Community Quarantine.

In compliance, we will be releasing soft copy/scanned copy of your child's SF-9 thru email starting June 8, 2020.

To facilitate collection of your active email account kindly accomplish the card distribution access form thru this link [https://forms.gle/n5A8cKs5XpAfhaCs8](https://forms.gle/n5A8cKs5XpAfhaCs8)

Thank you.

STAY SAFE ROSEANS!
