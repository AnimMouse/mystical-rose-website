OCTOBER | Month of the Holy Rosary

"The Rosary is the most beautiful and the richest in graces of all prayers; it is the prayer that touches most the Heart of the Mother of Godâ€¦and if you wish peace to reign in your homes, recite the family Rosary." ~Pope Saint Pius X

We would also like to extend the invitation to everyone to join the communal prayer of the Holy Rosary tomorrow, October 1, 2021, at 3:00.
