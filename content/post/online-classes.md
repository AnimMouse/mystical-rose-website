NO ONE STOPS LEARNING

In line with our commitment to continue the education of your children while ensuring their safety and well-being, all efforts are now being directed to transitioning to ONLINE CLASSES for the school year 2020-2021.

Thank you and stay safe!

In times of crisis when health and safety is a priority, firm decision making of the school leaders is indispensable and so this Learning Continuity Plan (LCP) was purposely made.

NO ONE STOPS LEARNING!

ALWAYS MAGKASAMA! ALWAYS MAGKABARKADA!
