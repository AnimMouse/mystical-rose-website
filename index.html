The Book signifies the wisdom, knowledge and dedication that the administrators, faculty and staff impart to every Rosean; The Dove between the Torch and Laurel leaves signifies the peaceful and harmonious relationship that exists among the administrators, teachers and students inside and outside and other sectors of the community. The Laurel Leaves represent the achievements that every Rosean has reaped and will continuously earn in the years to come </h2>
